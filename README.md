# OAuth2 Backend Login Client

Allow your frontend and backend users to add login possibilities via any OAuth2 provider. Popular examples are Github or Gitlab, Google, Facebook or LinkedIn or classically self-hosted solutions like Keycloak.

The extension allows administrators/integrators to configure various providers and offers any frontend and/or backend user an interface to add their OAuth2 based login.

This extension is especially powerful in combination with the Multi-Factor Capabilities of TYPO3 as you can provide backend users with a single-sign-on login of their choice and add additional security of MFA
to TYPO3.

For more info, please refer to the documentation.
